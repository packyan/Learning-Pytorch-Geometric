# Learning-Pytorch-Geometric

## Introduction

This repository is mainly a collection of some simple examples of learning PyG, with detailed procedures, from data loading, to model building, to training, forecasting, and visualization. 

And other demo about ML, such as PCA 

**It can be run directly in Google Colab.**
